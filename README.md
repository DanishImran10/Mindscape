# Mindscape: AR and VR Pathways to PTSD

**Mindscape** is an immersive educational application designed to raise awareness about **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**. The project uses **Virtual Reality (VR)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to deliver interactive modules that help users understand PTSD, its symptoms, and its impact on the brain.

## üéØ Purpose and Vision
Mindscape aims to fill the gap in mental health education, particularly in regions where mental health disorders are often misunderstood or stigmatized. The application creates **empathetic learning experiences** by simulating PTSD symptoms, explaining their causes, and engaging users with interactive content. By making PTSD education more accessible, Mindscape contributes to breaking the stigma around mental health disorders.

## üîç Modules Overview
### 1. Introduction to PTSD
The **Introduction Module** sets the foundation for understanding PTSD:
- Defines what PTSD is and how it differs from normal trauma responses.
- Discusses the **prevalence of PTSD worldwide** and its potential causes.
- Concludes by explaining **why PTSD happens** and previews upcoming modules.

### 2. Symptoms of PTSD
The **Symptoms Module** dives into the major symptom categories of PTSD:
- **Intrusive Memories**: Flashbacks, nightmares, and emotional distress.
- **Avoidance**: Avoiding reminders of trauma, people, or places.
- **Negative Changes in Thinking & Mood**: Guilt, shame, detachment, and loss of interest in activities.
- **Changes in Physical & Emotional Reactions**: Hyperarousal, irritability, sleep issues, and self-destructive behavior.
- The module includes **interactive activities** where users identify symptom categories based on character animations.

### 3. Triggers and Flashbacks
The **Triggers and Flashbacks Module** explains how PTSD triggers work:
- Defines what **triggers** are and how they can cause **flashbacks**.
- Provides common examples of triggers like loud noises or certain locations.
- Includes an **interactive simulation** where users experience how certain stimuli can trigger flashbacks in PTSD patients.
- Reinforces learning through a short quiz on identifying triggers in different scenarios.

### 4. Neuroscience (AR Module)
The **Neuroscience Module** uses Augmented Reality to visualize how PTSD affects the brain:
- Renders a **3D brain model** that users can explore.
- Highlights key brain regions like the **Amygdala**, **Hippocampus**, and **Prefrontal Cortex**.
- Describes how PTSD alters brain functions like fear processing and memory formation.

## üé≠ Character Design and Animation
Mindscape features **Mr. Neuron**, the host character guiding users through all modules.
- Mr. Neuron is **rigged and animated** to perform natural hand gestures during explanations.
- Custom animations were created for different interactions using Unity's **Animator Controller**.
- Characters were set up with **humanoid rigging systems** and motion curves to synchronize body movements with voiceovers.
- The animations include **idle states**, **pointing gestures**, and **walking sequences** to make the characters feel lifelike.

## üîë Features
- VR-based interactive modules with **gaze-based raycasting** for selecting objects.
- AR module with detailed **brain anatomy exploration**.
- Narrated by **Mr. Neuron**, the host character guiding users through all modules.
- **Interactive activities** to engage users and reinforce learning.
- Accessible mobile VR support using **Cardboard XR**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Unity (C#)
- Cardboard XR (VR)
- Vuforia (AR)
- 3D Models and Animations
- Raycasting Interaction System

## üéØ Target Audience
Mindscape is designed for:
- General public seeking **mental health education**.
- Families of PTSD patients.
- Educational institutions aiming to teach **empathy and awareness**.
